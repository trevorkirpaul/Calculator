# Calculator

A Calculator app single page web site created using vanilla JS

## 10.11.2017

  Number key and '+' key functionality has been added. I'm pretty sure I coded everything the hard way so
  I plan on refactoring at a later date. It'll be a great way to get used to dealing with multiple branches.

###update

	I had trouble with calculator funcionality so it's become a much more simple program.
