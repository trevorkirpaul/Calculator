# Calculator

A Calculator app single page web site created using vanilla JS

## 10.11.2017

Number key and '+' key functionality has been added. I'm pretty sure I coded everything the hard way so
I plan on refactoring at a later date. It'll be a great way to get used to dealing with multiple branches.

### update

~~I had trouble with calculator funcionality so it's become a much more simple program.~~

[`altJS`](https://github.com/trevorkirpaul/Calculator/tree/altJS) branch added. This contains js functionality that I actually am content with the direction of.
It took me a while to figure out how I wanted to deal with placeholding although it's still not a perfect system. 
I still need to implement a couple buttons' (*literally*) worth of functions and it'll be complete. I'll most likely merge `altJS` with `master` branch afterwards.
So far this project is helping me deal with the many options one can take when trying to solve a problem. I've created a few branches, 1 not even pushed to github, trying to figure out the most effective and user friendly method. Technically I could have looked up a js calculator app and copied code but it's nice to figure this out on my own.

### App Completed!

All functionality has been implemented and a title bas also added. There might be one obsure issue but this project is officially done and will no longer be worked on!

This project really helped me deal with the many ways a developer can tackle an issue. I also dealt with a much larger amount of variables. I'm sure in the future I can create an app like this much faster and with less code which is a direct result of dealing with this project.
My toolbelt concerning string and number manipulatiion has greatly increased and I can actually understand the entire code without getting a headache like when I started. I'm getting much more comfortable reading through the many layers of if/then statements and (unintended) code obfuscation.
With the many changes made, I also got much more comfortable using git which is a huge plus. I'm realizing git's amazing utility and it really makes things much easier. The fact that I can have multiple branches alone is something previously unfathomable. It's amazing how this process works even at the beginner stages.

If you've read this or tested the app, please let me know what you think. Code reviews are welcome as well as any advice you might have. Thanks!
