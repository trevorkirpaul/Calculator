# Calculator

A Calculator app single page web site created using vanilla JS

## 10.11.2017

Number key and '+' key functionality has been added. I'm pretty sure I coded everything the hard way so
I plan on refactoring at a later date. It'll be a great way to get used to dealing with multiple branches.

### update

~~I had trouble with calculator funcionality so it's become a much more simple program.~~

[`altJS`](https://github.com/trevorkirpaul/Calculator/tree/altJS) branch added. This contains js functionality that I actually am content with the direction of.
It took me a while to figure out how I wanted to deal with placeholding although it's still not a perfect system. 
I still need to implement a couple buttons' (*literally*) worth of functions and it'll be complete. I'll most likely merge `altJS` with `master` branch afterwards.
So far this project is helping me deal with the many options one can take when trying to solve a problem. I've created a few branches, 1 not even pushed to github, trying to figure out the most effective and user friendly method. Technically I could have looked up a js calculator app and copied code but it's nice to figure this out on my own.
